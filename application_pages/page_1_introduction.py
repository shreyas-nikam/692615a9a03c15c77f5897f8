    ## <h2 style=\"color:#0A2647;\">AI Risk Management Sandbox with Generative & Agentic AI Focus</h2>

    This interactive sandbox is designed to provide Risk Managers with a practical understanding of AI risks, particularly those associated with Generative AI (e.g., Large Language Models - LLMs) and Agentic AI systems. Through simulated scenarios, you will learn to assess, quantify, mitigate, and visualize the impact of various AI-related risks.

    ### Key Learning Objectives:

    *   **Understand different categories of AI risks:** Explore risks related to data, models, systems, human interaction, and organizational processes.
    *   **Quantify risk:** Learn to assess risk likelihood, impact (qualitative and monetary), and calculate the financial cost of potential failures.
    *   **Experiment with mitigation strategies:** Propose and simulate various mitigation techniques to observe their effects on risk reduction.
    *   **Visualize risk reduction:** Use interactive plots to compare risk profiles before and after implementing mitigation strategies.
    *   **Identify residual risks:** Recognize remaining risks and potential new challenges introduced by mitigation efforts.
    *   **Grasp key AI risk concepts:** Gain practical understanding of terms like `hallucinations`, `goal mis-specification`, `autonomy creep`, `error propagation`, `human-in-the-loop`, and `oversight mechanisms`.

    Let's begin our exploration into managing AI risks effectively.
